## Environment

This code is based on Matlab2018b, Python2.7 and Pytorch 0.4.1

## Data

For the VIPL-HR database, please refer to [this link](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/resources/databases/201811/t20181129_32716.html). An extended version of the VIPl-HR database (VIPL-HR-V2) can be accessed using [this link.](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/resources/databases/202007/t20200714_32718.html). For the OBF database, please contact [Xiaobai Li](https://www.oulu.fi/university/researcher/xiaobai-li) for more information.

## Data Processing 
The MSTmap generation procedure is based on Matlab. Please see the MSTmap_generation folder for more information. Both the [SeetaFaceEngine](https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine) (81 landmarks) and [OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) (68 landmarks) facial landmarks detection engines are supported.

## Training
This code is only an toy example of the training procedure. All the network structures and losses are provided. You need to adjust the Dataloader and training and test functions based on your own data.
